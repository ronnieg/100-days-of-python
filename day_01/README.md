# Day 1 - Beginner - Working with Variables in Python to Manage Data

## Exercise 1 - Printing

### Instructions

Write a program in main.py that prints the same notes from the previous lesson using what you have learnt about the Python print function.

**Warning:** The output in your program should match the example output shown below exactly, character for character, even spaces and symbols should be identical, otherwise the tests won't pass.

### Example Output

After you have written your code, you should run your program and it should print the following:
```shell
Day 1 - Python Print Function
The function is declared like this:
print('what to print')
```

## Exercise 2 - Debugging Practice

### Instructions

Look at the code in the code editor on the right. There are errors in all of the lines of code. Fix the code so that it runs without errors.
```shell
#Fix the code below ðŸ‘‡

print(Day 1 - String Manipulation")
print("String Concatenation is done with the "+" sign.")
  print('e.g. print("Hello " + "world")')
print(("New lines can be created with a backslash and n.")
```
**Warning:** The output in your program should match the example output shown below exactly, character for character, even spaces and symbols should be identical, otherwise the tests won't pass.

### Example Output
When you run your program, it should print the following:

```shell
Day 1 - String Manipulation
String Concatenation is done with the "+" sign.
e.g. print("Hello " + "world")
New lines can be created with a backslash and n.
```

## Exercise 3 - Input Function

### Instructions

Write a program that prints the number of characters in a user's name. You might need to Google for a function that calculates the length of a string.

e.g.

https://www.google.com/search?q=how+to+get+the+length+of+a+string+in+python+stack+overflow

**Warning.** Your program should work for different inputs. e.g. any name that you input.

### Example Input

```shell
Angela
```

### Example Output

```shell
6
```

## Exercise 4 - Variables

### Instructions

Write a program that switches the values stored in the variables a and b.

**Warning.** Do not change the code on lines 1-4 and 12-18. Your program should work for different inputs. e.g. any value of a and b.

### Example Input
```shell
a: 3
b: 5
```

#### Example Output
```shell
a: 5
b: 3
```
